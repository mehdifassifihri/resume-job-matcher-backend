- **Webhook support** - For asynchronous processing (custom implementation)
- **Batch processing** - Process multiple files (custom implementation)

### Can I use this with my ATS system?

Yes, the system is designed to work with ATS systems:
- **ATS validation** - Checks compliance with ATS requirements
- **Standard formatting** - Ensures proper resume structure
- **Keyword optimization** - Integrates job-specific keywords
- **Format compatibility** - Supports ATS-friendly formats

### How do I handle large volumes of requests?

For high-volume usage:
- **Horizontal scaling** - Deploy multiple instances
- **Load balancing** - Distribute requests across instances
- **Caching** - Cache results for repeated requests
- **Queue system** - Process requests asynchronously

## Troubleshooting

### The API returns "OpenAI API key not configured"

This error means your OpenAI API key is not set. Solutions:
1. **Check environment variables**: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **Verify .env file**: Ensure the key is in your .env file
3. **Restart the service**: After setting the key
4. **Check Docker environment**: If using Docker, ensure the key is passed

### Files are not being processed correctly

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Unsupported format**: Use PDF, DOCX, or TXT files only
2. **File too large**: Maximum size is 10MB per file
3. **Corrupted file**: Try with a different file
4. **Encoding issues**: Ensure files are properly encoded

### Processing is taking too long

Possible causes and solutions:
1. **Large files**: Break down into smaller files
2. **Network issues**: Check internet connection
3. **OpenAI API delays**: Check OpenAI status page
